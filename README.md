Description:
------------
Replaces the contents of the tab with the image on the page that has the largest dimensions. If the tab currently displays a single image, instead returns to the previous page. Can be applied to the current tab or all tabs to the right.

Installation:
-------------
Download and extract the zip file.
Turn on "Developer Mode" in the top right corner of the Chrome extensions page (chrome://extensions/).
Click on "Load Unpacked" in the top left corner.
Choose the extracted folder.

Instructions:
-------------
Access through the icon (pinnable on the extensions bar), through the context menu or through one of the two hotkeys - by default ctrl-shift-e and ctrl-shift-f. Not as robust as the one I wrote for Manifest v2, but good enough for now.

Primary use case is for automation on pages where the image is already the primary element, but also works well for image extraction on many pages where downloading is otherwise blocked (Instagram, Flickr, etc.)
