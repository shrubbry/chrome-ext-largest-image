Description:
------------
Replaces the contents of the tab with the image that has the largest dimensions. If the tab currently displays a single image, instead returns to the previous page. Can be applied to the current tab or all tabs to the right.

Installation:
-------------
Download and extract the zip file.
Turn on "Developer Mode" in the top right corner of the Chrome extensions page (chrome://extensions/).
Click on "Load Unpacked" in the top left corner.
Choose the extracted folder.

Instructions:
-------------
Access through the icon (pinnable on the extensions bar), through the context menu or through one of the two hotkeys - by default ctrl-shift-e and ctrl-shift-f - for the current tab and tabs-to-the-right, respectively.
Unlikely to change anything here, since I just needed a quick-and-dirty implementation for some reverse image searches - and because it will soon be obsolete when Chrome forces Manifest v3. If I migrate it over later, I'll make it more robust at that point.
